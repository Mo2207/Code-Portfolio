# Code-Portfolio

## Description:
  
This portfolio is where I'll be showing off any cool projects or recent code I've been working on. Its is currently more of a work in progress that I intend to expand upon as my skills expand as well.
  - My motivation was to expand my css knowledge and to work with media queries and flexbox and apply them accordingly.
  - I am building this portfolio to have a place where I can show potential employers my skills and accomplishments.
  - So far building this portfolio has helped me understand how media queries can be so useful, and how flexbox can make positioning a lot easier than before.
